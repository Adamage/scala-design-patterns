## Intent
Provide objects which follow value semantics rather than reference semantics.
This means value objects' equality are not based on identity. Two value objects are
equal when they have the same value, not necessarily being the same object.

Value object pattern is ubiquitous tool in functional programming (as a part of ADT concept),
and Scala offers complete support for value objects directly in the language.
