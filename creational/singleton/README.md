# Singleton Pattern


## Intent
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.


## Applicability
Use the Singleton pattern when
* there must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point.
* when the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying their code.
